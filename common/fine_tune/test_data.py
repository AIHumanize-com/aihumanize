input_text = """The advent of electric vehicles has been touted as a cornerstone in the transition towards sustainable transportation. With global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change, EVs have gained substantial attention and investment. This paper aims to dissect the multifaceted nature of EVs, weighing their advantages against the inherent limitations.

Benefits of Electric Vehicles:

Environmental Impact:
EVs offer a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, especially when powered by renewable energy sources. The absence of tailpipe emissions contributes significantly to improving air quality in urban areas.

Energy Efficiency:
Electric vehicles are inherently more efficient than their internal combustion engine counterparts. The direct conversion of electrical energy to power provides a higher efficiency rate, reducing overall energy consumption.

Performance Advantages:
Electric motors can provide instant torque, offering a smooth and swift acceleration. This feature, combined with low center of gravity designs, often results in superior handling and an enhanced driving experience.

Drawbacks of Electric Vehicles:

Limited Range and Range Anxiety:
Despite advancements, most EVs still offer a limited range compared to gasoline vehicles. This limitation, coupled with long charging times, contributes to range anxiety among potential consumers.

Charging Infrastructure:
The lack of widespread and uniform charging infrastructure remains a significant barrier. The variability in charging station availability, especially in rural or underserved urban areas, poses a challenge for long-distance travel."""


paraphrased = """Electric vehicles are hailed for being instrumental in shaping the future towards environmentally friendly transport means. Global initiatives aimed at curbing emission of carbon and tackling climate change have played pivot role in enhancing focus on EVs. This paper seeks to unpack the complex essence surrounding Evs and balance them against their limitations.

Benefits of Electric Vehicles:

Environmental Impact:
These vehicles reduce greenhouse gas emission substantially particularly, if their batteries are charged with renewable energy sources. Tailpipe emissions are almost eliminated and this plays a significant role towards improving air quality in urban areas.

Energy Efficiency:
There is no doubt that electric cars are much more efficient than conventional ones. Power can be directly converted from electrical energy without increasing the amount of energy consumed by the system.

Performance Advantages:
Instant torque is provided by electric motors allowing for fast and steady acceleration. The low COG (center of gravity) designs coupled with superior handling give enhanced driving experience as this feature contributes to the car’s high performance.

Drawbacks of Electric Vehicles:

Limited Range and Range Anxiety:
The fact is, despite advances, nearly all EVs do not cover much distance, compared to what gasoline-powered cars can achieve. This limitation together with long hours of charging causes ‘range anxiety’ for prospective buyers.

Charging Infrastructure:
Lack of widespread and uniform charging infrastructure continues to be one of the major hurdles. There is variability in charging stations in rural or underserved urban centers which pose challenges for long distance travel."""
