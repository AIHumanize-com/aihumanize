# original_text = """Basketball is a team sport played by two teams of five players each. The primary objective is to score points by shooting the basketball through the opponent's hoop, which is mounted on a backboard 10 feet (3.048 meters) above the ground. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Basketball is played on a rectangular court, typically indoors, with a surface made of wood or synthetic materials. The rules and regulations are governed by various organizations, such as FIBA (International Basketball Federation) and the NBA (National Basketball Association). The following is a general outline of the basic rules of basketball:
# 1. Game duration: A regulation basketball game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in the NBA and 10 minutes in FIBA play. College basketball in the US has two 20-minute halves. If the game is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods are played until a winner is determined.
# 2. Starting play: The game begins with a jump ball at the center of the court, where the referee throws the ball into the air, and one player from each team tries to gain possession by tapping it to a teammate.
# 3. Scoring: Points are scored by shooting the ball through the hoop. A field goal made from inside the three-point arc is worth two points, while a field goal made from outside the arc is worth three points. Free throws, awarded after a foul, are worth one point each.
# 4. Possession and dribbling: A player in possession of the ball must either pass it to a teammate or dribble (bounce) the ball while moving.
