The topic of language development has long been a subject of interest and discussion. Steven Pinker's thought-provoking article, "What the F*** " offers a perspective on this discourse. The author uses pathos, ethos, and logos to back up his points very well throughout the article. According to Pinker, language is constantly adjusting to meet the evolving demands of society, challenging the notion that it is declining. Acknowledging the importance of embracing changes in the changing environment is a key idea presented by Pinker. He asserts that perceptions of language decline often stem from nostalgia rather than reality. Pinker suggests that language has always been in flux, adapting alongside societal shifts throughout history. 
Pinker's argument highlights the adaptability of language as a characteristic that enables its continued existence and relevance. He emphasizes that language serves as a tool for communication, necessitating its evolution to convey ideas and messages in an ever-changing world effectively. Pinker provides evidence from the fields of linguistics and sociolinguistics to back up his viewpoint. He shows how language has developed over time to incorporate ideas and advancements, all while preserving its purpose.
Moreover, Pinker's work sheds light on the interconnection between language and society. He asserts that language serves as a reflection of values, norms, and cultural shifts. As society progresses, its language evolves in tandem, mirroring the transformations in interaction, self-expression, and navigating the world. By acknowledging this link between language and society, Pinker invites readers to recognize language as a responsive entity that enhances people's lives by facilitating communication and self expression. Steven Pinker's "What the F***" presents a thought provoking viewpoint on how language evolves over time. It proposes that language continually adapts to meet the changing needs of society. Embracing change does not signify deterioration. Rather demonstrates its vitality and resilience.
Pinker’s insights encourage people to reexamine their perceptions of language and its significance in their lives. Then, resisting changes, one should embrace them while acknowledging and appreciating the dynamic nature of language itself. This recognition empowers them to engage meaningfully in communication and understanding within their evolving global community. Moving forward, it became crucial to celebrate diversity alongside its evolution. Through this, people can contribute to a world where language acts as a bridge connecting people from cultures and generations and where the evolution of language is celebrated as a reflection of the shared human experience.
Steven Pinker's article "What the F*** " challenges the existing beliefs about the path of language development but also urges to see evolution as a natural and positive process. His insights prompt people to appreciate the flexibility and resilience of language by fostering an environment that celebrates diversity and welcomes conversations about language evolution. A society can be built that values the richness found in the ever-changing landscape of languages. Ultimately, embracing changes enables people to bridge divides, promote understanding, and ensure that language remains a crucial tool for communication in a constantly evolving global community.

The article discusses Pope Francis's call for a global ban on surrogate motherhood, equating it with child trafficking. The Pope, in remarks at a Vatican meeting with ambassadors, expressed his strong disapproval of the practice, labeling it a grave violation of the dignity of women and children. He urged the international community to universally prohibit surrogate motherhood, portraying it as a Western problem and part of a "culture of death" that discards vulnerable individuals.
Pope Francis has consistently upheld conservative church positions on reproductive health, opposing surrogacy, in vitro fertilization, and abortion. In this speech, he also reiterated his stance against "gender theory," which he deemed "extremely dangerous." The Pope's comments align with his previous likening of surrogacy to pornography and threats to human dignity.
The article highlights the conflict between the Pope's conservative views on reproductive issues and his liberal outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. It also delves into the political context in Italy, where the far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is pushing for a more restrictive law on surrogacy, seeking to expand the existing ban and impose penalties on parents seeking surrogacy overseas.
The story is newsworthy as it sheds light on the intersection of religious beliefs, political agendas, and societal debates surrounding reproductive technologies. It underscores the influence of religious figures, such as the Pope, in shaping public discourse and potentially impacting legislative decisions.
In terms of the seven dimensions of religion, the story highlights the doctrinal dimension as Pope Francis adheres to and promotes specific religious teachings against surrogacy. The moral dimension is evident in the Pope's characterization of surrogacy as a grave violation of dignity. Additionally, the social dimension is highlighted as political leaders like Giorgia Meloni align with religious views to shape legislation. The conflict between conservative religious beliefs and liberal societal values is a clear example of the ideological dimension.

The article discusses instances of churches, specifically Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock and the Upper Midwest Diocese of the Anglican Church in North America, withholding information about allegations of sexual abuse within their congregations. In both cases, leaders delayed informing their members, citing reasons such as awaiting the legal process to conclude or fearing the creation of scandals. The article highlights the tension between the church's desire to handle matters discreetly and the moral imperative of transparency when addressing abuse allegations.
The religious traditions described in the article are Southern Baptist Convention and the Anglican Church in North America. These traditions are characterized by a struggle to balance the preservation of the church's reputation with the ethical responsibility to inform the congregation about cases of abuse.
The conflicts faced by these churches revolve around the disclosure of abuse within their ranks. There is an internal struggle between the leaders' concerns about potential scandals and the need to be truthful and transparent with their members. The delay in informing the congregation has led to criticism and legal consequences for some church leaders.
Religion affects the daily lives of the people featured in the story by shaping their response to allegations of abuse within their religious communities. The leaders' decisions are influenced by a desire to protect the reputation of the church, reflecting the tension between religious values and the need for accountability.
The story is newsworthy because it sheds light on a persistent challenge within religious institutions – the handling of abuse allegations. It brings attention to the internal conflicts faced by church leaders, the impact on congregations, and the ethical considerations surrounding transparency and accountability.
In terms of the seven dimensions of religion, the story highlights the ritual and ethical dimensions. The ritual dimension is evident in the church leaders' decisions on when and how to inform the congregation, while the ethical dimension is prominent in the moral considerations surrounding the disclosure of abuse allegations.
Personally, I strongly agree with the viewpoint that church leaders have a moral imperative to inform their congregations about allegations of abuse. Transparency and accountability are essential elements of any ethical religious practice, and withholding such information can erode trust within the community. This aligns with the ethical dimension of religion emphasized in the article.
